        <h1>New Session, New Things</h1>
        <p>The 2024/2025 session kicked off in a more unusual way. Just like every other experienced person attending Vetland SNR, coming late to school is now of no use as more work(picking of leaves) will be assigned to you. <br>
        <br>
     <h3>Food Shed Position</h3>
          The food shed seemed to have been displaced from the back of the English department to the entrance of the school. This seems to have generated a new buzz of opinion among students as complaints were made.
    </p>
    <br>
   <h3>SS3 Uniform</h3>
   The new SS3 students came in with a fresh look on the resumption day. The long sleeve vibe was beyond top notch as it really set that  maturity in. Different students came in with their full composure and steeze sleeves.
