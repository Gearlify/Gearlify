        <h1>TEACHERS DAY CELEBRATION</h1>
        <p>OMG, the first day of the teachers day celebration was a blast. If wishes were the teachers today, I'm sure everyone would love to be a teacher. <br> The teachers almost blinded our eyes with their demure, steezeful and glamorous look, I must say, they dressed to kill.
      It was an entertainment galore at Vetland Senior Grammar School today with the funny mimicking of different teachers, even the colourful atmosphere the cultural dance troupe created during the celebration was magnifique. <br>
      This celebration will go on for three days and if the first day was this hot then the other two days will be hotter , don't miss school on these days o, e get why. 
      If you were anywhere near that scenario today ehn, you will want to be a teacher. The drama that unfolded after the event sef no be small
       Today's event was indeed a sight to behold.
